## UCGIS - BoK Annotation Tool (BAT)

The [BoK Annotation Tool (BAT)](https://ucgis-tools-bat.web.app) allows to easily annotate (associate) any PDF document with UCGIS BoK concepts, to be used later in the BoK Matching Tool (BMT) to discover best matches. BAT automatically edits the pdf file’s metadata, adding the requested annotations using the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

#### Authors
The UCGIS BoK tools are developed by the [Geospatial Technologies Research Group](http://geotec.uji.es/) (GEOTEC) from the University Jaume I, Castellón (Spain) and are Licensed under GNU GPLv3.
